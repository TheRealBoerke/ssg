# Vampire: The Masquerade

*Vampire: The Masquerade* is a gothic-punk roleplaying game that immerses players in a world of eternal darkness. Since its debut in 1991, it has introduced players to the complex societies and politics of vampires known as the **Kindred**.

## A Brief History of the Kindred

Long ago, in a time shrouded in myth, the first vampire—**Caine**—was cursed with eternal life after committing the first murder. From him, all other Kindred descend. The Third Generation, the **Antediluvians**, spawned the various clans we know today.

### The Rise and Fall of Empires

Throughout the centuries, vampires influenced the course of human history: from the Roman Empire to the French Revolution. Clans like the **Ventrue** guided kings and emperors, while the **Lasombra** manipulated the church.

- Manipulating monarchies
- Shaping religious orders
- Causing (and ending) wars

### The Masquerade

To protect themselves from human discovery, the **Masquerade** was established: a global conspiracy among Kindred to hide their existence from mortals.

## The Clans

Each clan carries unique powers and curses. Here’s an overview of some major players:
